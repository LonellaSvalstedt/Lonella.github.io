*"[...] he was unable to bear in his soul the crushing weight of so much past."*

The first book I've read that belonged to the genre of magical realism, and what an amazing book it is.
When I read One Hundred Years of Solitude, the themes that stood out to me most were the passage of time
and nostalgia. Gabriel Garcìa Màrquez has crafted such a convincing family and village, where every person
has unique desires and goals.

Something that I really liked about the book was its ability to convey the passage of time, and how
it is never portrayed as a straight line. The Buendía family tackle numerous setbacks, among them
a downpour that didn't stop for several years and an insomniac plague.

## Lords and Ladies - Terry Pratchett
#### publ. 1992, read 2022-05
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/LAL.jpg" />

*“If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That's what people remember.”*

The thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. I really appreciate how optimistic, joyful, and funny Terry Pratchett's books are.
For me they are the ultimate 'comfort food' books, easy to read and easy to enjoy. 

This book is about mythology, in the same way that 'Small Gods' is about religion. Terry Pratchett does a good job
of exploring mythological concepts in a way that feels fresh.
With this entry specifically I really enjoyed the character development. Terry Pratchett has a way of making characters
that simultaneously feel grounded and utterly fantastical.

## Slaughterhouse Five - Kurt Vonnegut
#### publ. 1969, read 2022-05
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/SL5.jpg" />

*“And so it goes...”*

An antiwar book about the bombing of Dresden, where almost twenty-five thousand people were killed. Kurt Vonnegut, the author, was present for the bombing.
The book is partly him coming to terms with the war. The book follows Billy Pilgrim, an American soldier in the second world war. It is told by an unreliable narrator,
in a non-linear order. 

The story features a lot of science-fiction elements. At first I was thrown off by this, thinking that this book was to be a more 'realistic' depiction of the war.
After having read it I think that the science-fiction elements serve to underline the cruelty of the war.
